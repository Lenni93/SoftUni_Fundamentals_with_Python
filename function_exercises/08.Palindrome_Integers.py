# Here are some interesting facts about palindromic numbers:
#
# The first 30 palindromic numbers (in decimal) are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11,
# 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111, 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171, 181, 191, 202, … 1.
# Palindromic numbers receive attention in recreational mathematics. For instance:
# Palindromic primes: Examples include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 101, 131, 151, … 1.
# Palindromic square numbers: Examples include 0, 1, 4, 9, 121, 484, 676, 10201, 12321, … 1.
