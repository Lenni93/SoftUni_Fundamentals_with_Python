# You will receive two lines of input:
# 路 a list of employees' happiness as a string of numbers separated by a single space
# 路 a happiness improvement factor (single number).
# Your task is to find out if the employees are generally happy in their office.
# First, multiply each employee's happiness by the factor.
# Then, print one of the following lines:
# 路 If half or more of the employees have happiness greater than or equal to the average:
# "Score: {happy_count}/{total_count}. Employees are happy!"
# 路 Otherwise:
# "Score: {happy_count}/{total_count}. Employees are not happy!"
